The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a b?@#$.

**It's a cost that you sustained in the past (be it time, money, energy, whatever) and cannot be reversed, cancelled or undone.**

The fallacy is that yet *knowing about the sunk cost of a project*, you are often tempted to *justify your future investments* because of your past (most likely lost) investments.

The sunk cost *should not influence your future decisions*, yet it does. And the outcomes are often delusion, sadness and stress.

## Cut your losses

You might get *emotionally* attached to your projects.

Your idea "is awesome!", yet your **expectations** are not met by others.

You can't possibly understand why your project doesn't do as well as you have **hoped**.

You spent the last month *contacting potential clients, shipped v1/v2/v3/Beta1 and Beta2, optimized your landing page to maximize conversions*.

Yet nobody gives *a flying fuck* about your project, although your research and feedback received.

**This is when you should cut your losses.**

## Move on

It's perfectly normal to feel stressed/disappointed when you need to cut your losses and move on.

**But you need to realize it.**

If you don't realize it, or realize it too late, *you get burned*.

**You get burned by your own emotional decisions, which should have been rational all along.**

**It's business decision making after all.**

> It's not kindergarten where you just cry out loud and a nanny comes to cheer you up and console you.

*Just move on.*

It seemed a good idea in theory, but people have better things to do than to *feel pity over your failure*.

**And you do too.**

## Learn from your mistakes

You have nothing left to do than to learn from what you did **wrong**.

> Write it down. 
>
> Visualize the process you followed. 
>
> Maybe it wasn't that good after all.

Did you first of all understood that there was a real *value* for your potential customers, or you just thought *people would donate you money* because you spent months on your pretty project?

As you might have noticed, **You** is mentioned quite a few times in this post.

*This should make you reflect.*

It's not about you, but about **market, niches, interests, potential clients, value proposition, communication, marketing, connections, content.**
