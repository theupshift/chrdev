First of all: this is based on the idea of https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/ and https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history

The gist:

- every 20min
  - scrape hackernews frontpage items
  - save them in `hn.json`
  - commit and push

Find the git repository here at [christian-fei/hn-history](https://github.com/christian-fei/hn-history)

The schedule is done with the following GitHub Workflow file:

```yml
name: scrape hn data

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '5,25,45 * * * *'

jobs:
  scheduled:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: fetch hndata
      run: |-
        npx @christian_fei/hn --json | jq . > hn.json
    - name: Commit and push if it changed
      run: |-
        git config user.name "Automated"
        git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add -A
        timestamp=$(date -u)
        git commit -m "Latest data: ${timestamp}" || exit 0
        git push
```

The data is scraped with `@christian_fei/hn` using the `--json` flag.

# Git diff FTW

The diff looks actually quite comprehensive:
